# Compiler_design
🛠️ Compiler Design Starter Project
Learn how compilers work by building one from scratch!

This repository helps you understand the basics of compiling code:

Lexer: Breaks code into tokens (like words and numbers).

Parser: Checks syntax (like grammar rules).

Semantic Analyzer: Ensures code makes sense (e.g., no adding strings to integers).

Code Generator: Converts code to assembly/another language.

🌟 What’s Inside?
Example code for each compiler stage (lexer, parser, etc.).

Simple language examples (math expressions, variables).

Step-by-step guides to build your own tiny compiler.

🛑 Prerequisites
Basic C/C++ or Python knowledge.
